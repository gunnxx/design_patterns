### Disclaimer
This repository is my personal project as I am currently reading [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58128.Head_First_Design_Patterns) and sharperning my [Modern C++](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/teaching/modern-cpp/) understanding. The codes are examples provided in each chapters of the book, rewritten in C++, C++14 to be exact, instead of Java.
